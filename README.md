> 🤔 **Note**: This project exists because I was too lazy to manually configure my system every time. It might work, it might break your system, or it might just make your computer feel appreciated. Who knows? It's like playing Russian roulette with your Arch install (but with better odds... probably).

### 🚀 Features

- 🔧 **CPU Go Brrr** · Makes your CPU feel special
- 💾 **Memory Magic** · Because who needs RAM when you have dreams
- ⚡ **I/O Stuff** · Makes disks spin faster (or slower, who knows?)
- 🛠️ **Service Tweaks** · Tells systemd to behave (good luck)
- 📦 **Package Things** · Installs stuff you probably don't need
- ⚙️ **Dotfiles** · Because plain files are too mainstream

### 📥 Installation

```bash
# Clone this masterpiece
git clone https://github.com/elysiumayo/Aetheros.git

# Enter the danger zone
cd Aetheros

# Make it executable (if you dare)
chmod +x master.sh

# Launch and pray
./master.sh
```
